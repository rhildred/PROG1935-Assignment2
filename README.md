## Recipe Finder

The Recipe Finder project will allow users to search for recipes, view search results,
save favorite recipes, and explore recipe details in a dedicated page. It reinforces skills
related to DOM manipulation, event handling, APIs, JSON, loops, conditionals, arrays,
and functions.
